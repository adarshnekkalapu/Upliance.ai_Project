Data Analyst Intern Assignment
This project involves analyzing user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends from a dataset consisting of three sheets: UserDetails, CookingSessions, and OrderDetails. The objective of this analysis is to uncover patterns in user demographics, meal preferences, and the relationship between cooking sessions and orders. The insights from this analysis can help optimize business strategies, marketing campaigns, and improve user engagement.

Project Overview
This project explores a dataset that provides insights into user behavior, cooking sessions, and order data. The analysis aims to:
•	Clean and merge the data from three datasets (UserDetails, CookingSessions, OrderDetails).
•	Analyze the relationship between user demographics, cooking sessions, and orders.
•	Identify popular dishes and examine order trends.
•	Provide business recommendations based on the findings.
Data Preparation
The data from three separate sheets in an Excel workbook (Data Analyst Intern Assignment - Excel.xlsx) were loaded into pandas DataFrames using pandas.read_excel(). The data is then cleaned and preprocessed:
•	Date Columns: Converted relevant columns (e.g., Registration Date, Session Start, Session End, Order Date) to datetime type for easier analysis.
•	Merged Data: The data from UserDetails, CookingSessions, and OrderDetails were merged based on common keys (User ID and Session ID).
•	Missing Data: Missing ratings in the merged_data were filled with the mean rating value to ensure consistency.
Data Analysis and Insights
Key steps in the analysis include:
1.	User Demographics and Meal Preferences:
o	Users are mostly younger adults, and Dinner is the most popular meal type.
o	The average number of orders per user varies, but generally, users in major cities like New York and Los Angeles order more frequently.
2.	Popular Dishes:
o	The most popular dishes across orders and cooking sessions include Spaghetti, Grilled Chicken, and Caesar Salad.
o	A cross-analysis was conducted to determine common popular dishes in both orders and cooking sessions, revealing strong overlap.
3.	Order and Session Ratings:
o	Session ratings tend to be high, with a positive correlation between session duration and user satisfaction.
o	Ratings for orders vary by status (e.g., Completed, Canceled), and the analysis shows how order status affects user satisfaction.
4.	Geographic Insights:
o	The analysis includes a breakdown of average session ratings by user location, identifying regional trends in user satisfaction.
5.	User Spending Patterns:
o	Spending is generally higher during dinner orders compared to other meals (breakfast and lunch).
o	A heatmap of total orders by Age and Favorite Meal demonstrates how age impacts meal preferences.
Visualizations
The project includes several key visualizations:
1.	Correlation Heatmap: Displays the correlation between numerical variables in the dataset.
2.	Most Popular Dishes (Orders): A bar chart showcasing the most popular dishes based on order count.
3.	Age Distribution of Users: A histogram illustrating the age distribution of users.
4.	Order Amount by Meal Type: A boxplot depicting the distribution of order amounts across different meal types.
5.	Session Duration vs Rating: A scatterplot showing the relationship between session duration and rating.
6.	Average Session Rating by Location: A bar chart showing the average session ratings by user location.
7.	Heatmap of User Demographics and Favorite Meals: A heatmap visualizing the total orders by age and favorite meal.
Business Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:
•	Target Marketing: Focus on younger adults (25-35 years old) in cities with high order volume (e.g., New York, Los Angeles). Tailor meal offerings to their preferences, such as quick and healthy meals for lunch.
•	Dinner Promotions: Since dinner orders are more frequent and tend to have higher amounts, create promotions or special discounts for dinner meals.
•	Improve User Engagement: Enhance user experience during longer cooking sessions by providing recipe guidance or video tutorials to boost user satisfaction.
•	Order Cancellations: Investigate reasons behind order cancellations and take steps to improve the ordering process, possibly by offering incentives or discounts to reduce cancellations.
•	Regional Personalization: Create localized promotions or meal offerings based on regional trends in user behavior (e.g., users in different cities may have different preferences).
Conclusion
The dataset provides a detailed picture of user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends. Key insights include:
•	A large portion of the user base is made up of young adults, with a strong preference for dinner meals.
•	Popular dishes like Spaghetti and Grilled Chicken dominate both cooking sessions and orders.
•	Positive session ratings suggest that users are satisfied with the overall cooking experience, though there are opportunities to further engage them.
These findings can inform targeted marketing, optimize meal offerings, and enhance user satisfaction, leading to higher engagement and revenue.
Technologies Used
•	Python
•	Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
•	Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
•	Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis and exploration.
